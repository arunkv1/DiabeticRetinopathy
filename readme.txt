Running the Project:

To run the project, all you have to do is change the path to the file name in all the python files. The current file name is on our aws s3 bucket, so just change the file name to the one on your own personal computer. Also, in order to run the data bricks package's functions, you will need to download the necessary versions of the packages. The DeepImageFeaturizer will only work with tensor flow 1.6, and keras 2.5. In addition to this, you may have to download other required pip libraries and the current versions to make the code work. We created a conda environment on our EMR cluster, and downloaded all the required packages and correct versions for it to run perfectly. Once the correct versions are installed from the list in this readme file. Then the code will run perfectly. If you are having trouble running the file, feel free to reach out to us. Our emails are at the end of this readme file.
